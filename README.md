# LFN Personal Developer Portfolio

Hello, my name is lfn or BlueJ. I am a beginner level Java programmer still in the works. Currently, I am still getting comfortable with Spigot API to make custom server plugins for Minecraft. Minecraft has been a big part of the gaming industry and for programmers world wide. Me learning Java has been an experience and a half, and since I was 12, it's been a dream of mine to take part in the developer world that is today. I am confident that I will be able to bring customers their desired custom plugin with in a reasonable amount of time at an affordable cost.

## Experience
I have beeen part of the minecraft community for 7+ years, starting on the Xbox 360. Little did I know this was the beginning of a development career of my own. I have been server managing for about 4+ years, learning the ins and outs of server managment. Over that time span I have been able to learn Java through tutorials and self teaching. Though it was a rocky start and switching between games and languages, I have set my desired language to Java. Learning SpigotAPI aswell as SQLite databases, I have been able to start a new desired career.
